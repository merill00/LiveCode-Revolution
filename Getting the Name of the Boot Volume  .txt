If I understand your question, it sounds like the tempName is what you want.

Perhaps the following would do what you need: 
function getBootVolume
  if "Win" is in platform() then
    set itemDel to "\"
    put item 1 of tempName() into tVolume
  end if
  if "Mac" is in platform() then
    set itemDel to "/"
    put item 2 of tempName() into tVolume
  end if
  return tVolume
end getBootVolume
