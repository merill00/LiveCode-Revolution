How To Connect to a mySQL Database

Download the latest version of Revolution. The driver (libmysql.bundle) is distributed with it. Simple keep it in the same directory as the application and you should be fine. You should be able to download the latest version of Rev and use the database tools, and database samples (see the contributions page) without installing any additional files. The software db demo samples is compatible with all databases.

You can distribute the mysql client library, but users will need to connect to the mysql server. If your looking for a single user database, try Valentina. The necessary Valentina files are distributed with RunRev, and the software db demo, and translator demo both work with it.

MySQL is a relational database management system, and as such is designed for remote access from multiple users. A MySQL server will need to be installed on the web server, chances are that mysql is already installed. If you are looking for a single user database try Valentina. 

It will be possible to use RevDB for faceless CGIs in the next version.
