The download links are divided into five parts, including:  <b>(1) The DDM-Template</b>, which is the open source code, essentially a shell you modify to make your own DDM, using the programming environment Revolution.  This includes the Template file directories, which are the folders or directories into which you place your map files, images and movies so your DDM can access them (replacing those included for use by the DDM-Template). <b>(2) The DDM-Updater </b>, which is a program used to apply bug fixes and add capability to existing DDMs that were built starting with an earlier DDM-Template. You load open the DDMUpdater stack in Revolution after you open an existing DDM, and apply the changes by clicking on buttons in the Updater.  <b>Always</b> back up existing DDMs and retain them before using the Updater, and test the new version after the updater is applied.  <b>(3) Ten short videos</b> introducing you to the Revolution programming environment. <b>(4) A "Learning Documents"</b> archive that contains files on how to make DDMs. It includes (a) A tutorial document that introduces you to working in the Revolution programming environment. (b) A second tutorial that steps you through just the bare-bones of how to make a basic DDM from pre-assembled files, using the DDM-Template. (c) Several text documents, used to help you format the lists for the map and image DDM indexes, (d) A file renamer utility (an update of September 2006, with the Mac version now a Universal application), and (e) A pdf file of the DDM-Cookbook (see 5 next). <b>(5) The DDM-Cookbook</b>, in pdf format, which is a detailed guide in how to use the above componets, to make your own DDM. To use the Cookbook I assume you have already invested the eight or so hours it will take to work through the videos and the tutorials included in the "Learning Documents" archive.
