It is essentially a shell into which you insert the information needed to make your own DDM.  You do this by opening the program in Revolution, and use its interface to replace or modify the existing parts of ddm-template with your own.  <hr>The folder also contains all the needed folders, filled with "dummy" or place-holder files, that are used initially by the ddm-template.rev program.  Copy the main folder (drag it to your hard drive), and rename the folder whatever acronym you are using for your new DDM.  For example, if I were creating a DDM of my home town, I might call the program DDM-Leverett.rev, and I would change the name of the folder from "ddm-template" to "DDM-Leverett"(or ddm-leverett).  <hr>Your next step will be to replace the "place holder" files in the sub-folders with your own.   For example, place all the jpeg image files you want to include in your DDM into the "imagprod" folder, after first removing those that were being used by the DDM-Template.  Likewise, replace the jpeg map files in the "mapprod1" folder with those that you want to use for your default or primary thematic maps.  Continue this process, as outlined in the DDM-Cookbook, which is written following the sequential step-by-step procedure you should use to make your own DDM.  Note that sub-folders in this "ddm-template" folder may exist for file types you will not be using (for example, crosssec, figures).  Feel free to remove them, or if you might want to use them later, leave them in your own DDM's folder.  One critical folder that is essential to all DDMs is the "datadir" folder:  do not remove it!.<hr>You may see other files in the ddm-template folder:  these are included for informational purposes only.  They may include "ddm-changes.pdf", a "ReadMe" file, an "index.html" file and an associated " templatefolderimage.jpg" file.  You'll probably want to replace the "index.tml" file at it's associated image " templatefolderimage.jpg" with those specifically made for the web page of your own DDM.  As to the other files listed above, after reading them, delete them.  If you want your DDM to include a mouse "Click" sound, especially useful if you include an automated tour, you might want to leave the "click.wav"  file in your main folder.  Likewise, when you make a stand-alone program from your Revolution DDM, if you include any speech capability, you'll want to add the "Externals" folder that is created by Revolution in the process of making your "SAs", or Windows machines will not be able to speak at you!<hr>I'd suggest your next step is to go to the "Learning Docs" folder and look at the "_WhereToStart.rtf" file.</p></font></body></html>
