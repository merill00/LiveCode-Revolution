    Revolution Shortcuts

The Revolution development environment is very powerful, with lots of
menus, palettes, toolbars, etc. that let you create, edit and script
objects. In fact, there are so many tools and capabilities available
from these places that you can spend a lot of time moving from your
keyboard to your mouse and moving the mouse around the screen to find
the tool you need. To help speed things up, there are many keyboard
shortcuts built into Revolution. It can save you lots of time over the
long run to learn some of the shortcuts for functionality that you use
often. Here is a handy list of some of the most useful keyboard shortcuts.

Notes:

    * In the examples below, the shortcuts for the Mac OS will be shown
      on the left and the shortcuts for Windows and Unix/Linux on the right.
    * The ⌘ symbol refers to the "Command", or Apple, key on Apple
      keyboards.
    * On Mac systems with a multi-button mouse right click is the same
      as control+click.
