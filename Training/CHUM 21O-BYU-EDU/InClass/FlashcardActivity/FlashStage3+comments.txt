STAGE 3 

• In this stage, we're going to be deleting words from the lists as we go through them, so we need a way to preserve the original lists.
First duplicate the word fields, and make one field the "master": 
  field "englishWords Master" holds the list of English words
  field "frenchWords Master" holds the list of French words
The idea is to never delete anything from these master fields.


# Card script
on pick
  put the promptLanguage of this card & "Words" into promptFld
  put the responseLanguage of this card & "Words" into responseFld
  
  put number of lines of fld "englishWords" into lineCount
  put random(lineCount) into whichLine
  # check to see if we're out of words, and inform the user.
  if lineCount = 0 then
    answer "You’ve finished all the words."
    put empty into field promptFld
    put empty into field responseFld
    exit to top
  end if
  put line whichLine of field promptFld into fld "prompt"
  put line whichLine of field responseFld into fld "response"
  
  # delete the word from the two fields
  #  (Remember to first create Master fields to hold the lists--
  #    see the setup handler)
  delete line whichLine of field "EnglishWords"
  delete line whichline of field "FrenchWords"

end pick

# Also in Card script
on setup
  # Since we're going to be deleting words from the lists as we go,
  #  we have to "reload" the lists from the master lists each time 
  #  we start the quiz.
  put field "englishWords Master" into field "englishWords"
  put field "frenchWords Master" into field "frenchWords"	
  hide field "englishWords"
  hide field "FrenchWords"
  # Now we also have to make sure we hide the master list fields.
  hide field "englishWords Master"
  hide field "frenchWords Master"
  put empty into fld "prompt"
  put empty into fld "response"
end setup

# button "next"
