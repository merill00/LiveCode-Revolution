STAGE 4

¥ Create a tabbed button in place of the "choose" button, with two tabs "Test English" and "Test French". This will replace the "choose" button.
¥ Tabbed buttons are a type of menu button. Menu buttons receive all mouse messages, PLUS a menuPick message when one of the choices is clicked. The menuPick message sends two pieces of information along with it, called "parameters": the first one is the text of the tab being clicked, and the second one is the text of the tab that had been picked previously.

## button "selectionTabs"

# This is how to find out which tab was clicked and which one was selected previously.
