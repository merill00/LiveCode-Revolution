Once upon a time there was a little girl named Goldie Locks.  Goldie Locks was a bad little girl.  She always tried to use others things.  
One day she went walking in the forest and came to a little house.  She knocked on the door and no one answered so she went inside.  She was surprised to find no one in the house.  
She came into the living room first where she saw three chairs.  One big chair it was very hard. One medium size chair it was very soft. One very small chair it was just right.  So she sat down in it for a little while reading books and listening to some CDs. 
She then went into the kitchen because she was hungry.  She found three bowls three spoons and three pieces of bread.  She looked at the big bowl first but the soup was too hot.  She then looked at the medium sized bowl but it was too cold.  At last she looked at the small bowl and it was just right. 
After eating she went upstairs and found 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, 3 beds, 3 blankets and three pillows. She decided to take a nap.  She first went to the big bed but it was too hard the second bed was too soft but the third bed was just right.  So she took a nap. 
While she was sleeping the three bears came home and took out three keys for the three doors.  When they came in they knew that something wasn’t right with the house.  The living room was a mess with books, keys, videos, movies, and babies all over the floor.  
In the kitchen someone had eaten their soup which mother bear had prepared for them.  The bowls, cups, dishes, matches, potatoes and tomatoes were out of their place.  Then they went up to the bedroom. 
When they went inside it they found her lying on their beds.  All three bears were very upset and told Goldie Locks to leave with all of her things. Goldie Locks was so scared that she ran out of the three doors and never came back.  The Bears lived happily ever after never being disturbed again.
