        Scripting Style Guide <../embassy/articles/scriptstyle.html>
        *Helpful tips for xTalk, Lingo, and other 4GLs*

like C++, but this ease of use can seduce us into use a less desciplined
code style which is hard to read and costly to maintain. By adopting
some of the best practices of formal languages, scripters can reduce
errors and shorten development cycles.
