List Fields: Scrolling to a Line on Keypress  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> I have a cd with 3 flds
>
> One of those flds is a scrolling list field
> The text in the fld is a list sorted alphabetically
>
> I'd like that when the user press a keybord key, the fld scroll so that 
> the first words in the fld begin with this letter

put this in the card-script:


## fld 1 is the list-field.

on keyUp lekey
   if lekey is "a" then
  ## or whatever is your first letter
     set the scroll of fld 1 to 0
     exit keyup
     ## will scroll to top
   end if
   put lineOffset(CR & lekey, field 1) into lo
   set the scroll of field 1 to lo * the effective textHeight of field 1
   if lo is 0 then
     beep
     ## or whatever...
   end if
end keyUp
			
Tested and works. You can enhance it by adding some automatic hiliting or send "mouseup" etc...
