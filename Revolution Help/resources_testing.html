			<h2><strong>How To Test Your Stacks</strong></h2> <h3>(or) Gee, It Doesn't Do That On My Machine</h3> <cite>by Jacqueline Landman Gay
				<br>
					HyperActive Software</cite> 
			<p>
There is one single thing that defines a top-quality HyperCard stack:
everything works. This may sound simplistic, but it's the bottom line.
It doesn't matter how slick your user interface is, or how tricky the
scripts are, or how sophisticated the material you are presenting; if
everything in the stack doesn't work exactly right, your work will be
ignored -- or worse, scorned -- by others. </p>
			<p> There's no secret to creating a great stack that
people will use and enjoy. Test the stack and everything in it, again
and again. Run everything though its paces several times and in
different orders. Click every button, read and scroll every field, run
every script. Show every dialog -- and when you do, try every possible
response button. Restart HyperCard with different amounts of memory
assigned in the Finder and run your stack again. Then get all your
friends to do the same thing too. </p>
			<p>
				That's it. Everything else I'm about to tell you is just commentary.
			</p>
			<p>
Most stack errors and mistakes can be prevented by using a few simple
testing techniques. Unfortunately, too many authors don't want to take
the time to test their work adequately. While the fun may be in
designing and scripting a stack, remember that everyone else's opinion
of it will be based on its performance. Users have high expectations of
software these days, and they won't take time to figure out
work-arounds to glitches. They'll just toss your stack in the trash
instead. Worse yet, they may avoid your work in the future based on one
bad experience. </p>
			<p> Try the following tips before releasing your stack.
You may be surprised what you find. These techniques should ensure that
your stack is as bug-free as it can be. </p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Pretend you just met your stack</b>
in a crowded library and you don't know anything about it. Start
clicking on (or typing into) everything. This doesn't just mean using
the obvious buttons; it means, for example, clicking on locked fields
that have scripts, and using all dialog boxes. Repeatedly bring up
every dialog box until you have tried all possible responses to it, and
don't forget "cancel". Too many scripts don't account for a user
wanting to bail out. Don't forget any buttons that are hidden on the
card right now but that might be visible and used later; activate and
use those buttons too. Every button should do exactly as it is labeled
(so choose your button names carefully.) Every script should interact
cleanly with everything else in your stack, without causing any errors.
</p>
					<p> Click outside any buttons or fields, right on the
card itself, to be sure that nothing unexpected happens. If you've
created any menus, systematically choose every single menu item, one at
a time, to be sure it behaves right. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<b>Set up some fake data</b>
with known content and test with that. Say you have a stack that opens
a text file of numbers and totals them. Set up a text file and get a
total with your hand calculator. Then run your stack on the file and
see if you get the same results. Or suppose you have a script that
counts the number of times a text string occurs in another stack. Set
up the other stack with a known number of repetitions of some text and
then see if your script returns the right number. Too often scripters
will suppose that if the script doesn't error when it runs, it must be
okay. All that means is that you haven't any syntax errors; it doesn't
say anything about the accuracy of the results when the script is done.
Do tests on several different sets of known data. One set isn't enough;
you need to account for all types of variation. In the first example
above, you might create a text file containing all numbers except for
one line of text. What happens when you run your script on that? </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Once you've tried everything, and I mean everything, <b>go back and try it all over again</b>
in a different order, preferably the wrong order. This will be
incredibly educational. Don't fool yourself into thinking that your
users will click all the buttons in the correct order, or even in any
logical order (although your stack must present everything in an
orderly way.) For example, what happens if a user decides to push a
"calculate" button before they enter any data into some number fields?
Does the script give an explanation of what to do and then exit
gracefully? Or does it error out half finished and leave the stack in
an unpredictable state? What happens if users enter letters and other
symbols that aren't numbers, or type in numbers in the wrong range
(always test-enter numerical data as negative numbers at least once.)
What happens to your other scripts when one script fails? Do you get a
cascading failure when each succeeding handler looks for information
that now doesn't exist, or exists in the wrong format? </p>
					<p> Try your hardest to enter incorrect information
into every field, enter data in the wrong format, and click every
button out of logical order. While it is fine if this doesn't produce
any usable results, it should definitely not produce any script error
dialogs either. If it does, you haven't done enough error-checking in
your scripts. Don't think to yourself, "my stack is aimed at Mensa
members with IQ's over 165 and they would never do that sort of thing,
so I don't have to check for it." Trust me, they will. And you do. </p>
					<p> Whenever you repair a script, no matter how small
the change, start the testing process over again. There's no way around
it; you have to be sure not only that the change in your script works
correctly, but that it works correctly with everything else. You can
use some judgment here. If you alter a script that displays information
in a field, you probably only have to test that one script to be sure
the display is correct. But if any other part of your stack uses the
data in that field later, then you need to re-test every other script
that uses that field information. This may sound tedious, but it is the
only way to avoid one of the main causes of errors -- the interaction
of different elements of your stack. </p>
				</li><li>
					<p>
						<b>Get three other people to run your stack.</b>
This is hugely important. Never, ever release a stack that no one else
has used. If you don't know three other people, at least get one. If
you know more than three, go for as many as you can rope into it. No
two people will use your stack the same way. Certainly no one will use
it exactly the way you think they will. What they do with your stack
will tell you worlds about your work. </p>
					<p> Choose people for testing who are as close as
possible to the kinds of people who will be downloading and using your
stack. If your stack is for children, use children to test it. If your
stack is for anthropology professors, find some of those. If you don't
know any anthropology professors then you can use your mother if you
have to, but don't expect her to find all the anthropology mistakes.
She will, however, probably still find a lot of generic errors having
to do with stack design. </p>
					<p>
						<b>Don't tell your testers what to do.</b>
This is a strict rule. Let them read any documentation or Read Me files
you will upload with your stack, but that's all. This is easier said
than done, but remember that no one who downloads your stack will have
you around to give them verbal directions, and your tester shouldn't
get any either. So limit yourself to watching, bite your tongue, and
take a lot of notes. See what actions they choose to do first, where
they get stuck, and how they look around in the stack for help if they
need it (you did put some help info in there, right?) This will tell
you where your stack design isn't clear. Don't offer any advice unless
the other person asks outright, and in that case give as little
information as possible to get them back on track. </p>
					<p> When they're done, you can ask them questions from
your notes if you need to. Ask what they thought was good about the
stack and what was not so good. Pay attention to what they say and
change your stack if necessary. Try not to decide that they "didn't
know what they were doing" and don't dismiss their comments as
irrelevant. If your testers can't figure out your stack, probably no
one else can either. </p>
				</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<b>Run your stack on other people's Macs</b>,
the more the better. Is your card size too big to show up fully on a 9"
screen? Did you put buttons, graphics, or other important items in the
space that is under the menu bar on these smaller screens? How about
speed? Is it acceptable on other Macs? This is more important on
animations; what looks great on your SE will fly by so fast on a Quadra
that it is unrecognizable. What about the timing of your sound effects
on various Macs? Card transitions? What happens when your color stack
is run on a black and white Mac? You'll learn a lot. </p>
			</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				There's one last way guaranteed to find every possible obscure bug, hiccup, and glitch in your stack: <b>demo the stack to someone else</b>.
No matter how much testing you've done or how many people have gone
over your work, if there's one obscure thing that can go wrong, it will
gleefully manifest itself when you are trying to show your work to an
important person -- like a potential client, your latest love interest,
or your anthropology professor. Those tiny little bugs that have been
lurking under the paint layer just drooling for a chance to embarrass
you will burst suddenly on screen, grinning and winking at each other.
If you really, really want to find minute and obscure bugs, try showing
off your stack with as much pride as possible to someone important. </p>
		</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<b>Avoid the "it's my baby" syndrome.</b>
It is tempting, after spending a lot of time with a stack, to want to
leave it just as it is, simply because it's your baby. Be ruthless.
Even babies are better for a little discipline. If something isn't
appropriate for your stack's purpose, take it out, no matter how cute
it is or how much time you spent writing it. If your testers complain
that fourteen repetitions of Alvin the Chipmunk singing "Swanee" are a
bit excessive, take Alvin to the trash no matter how cute you think he
may be. Remain constantly flexible. You don't have to change everything
your testers say (after all, they really might NOT know what they're
doing), but you should sure listen closely when they say it. </p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p> If you follow these testing guidelines, you can produce stacks that
are consistently bug-free and reliable. The longer you test, the more
people you test with, and the more repeatedly you test, the better your
stacks get. Even the simplest stack can become pure Hyper-art when it
runs smoothly, behaves intuitively, and functions without errors. <br>
