			<h3>A mouse() on a hamster wheel</h3>
A common scripting technique in any x-talk language is polling the
mouse in order to get information about its state so that a script can
perform an action. In HyperCard or SuperCard, for example, it is
customary when simulating a dragging operation to use a repeat loop to
get <code>the mouseLoc</code> in order to repeatedly set an object to
the mouse location, or to check in a loop for a mouse condition to
determine when to leave the loop. Here is a common example: <blockquote>
<pre>repeat until the mouse is up
  set the loc of btn "dragBtn" to the mouseLoc
end repeat</pre> 
			</blockquote>
			<p class="first">
In MetaCard and Revolution, this kind of mouse polling is emphatically
discouraged. Scott Raney of MetaCard Corporation has this to say about
the above repeat construct: </p>
			<blockquote>
				<i> This loop uses 100% of the CPU time,
regardless of the speed of the processor, bringing the system to its
knees, causing poor feedback for your app, and making your system
unresponsive to any other processes running on it. You see, on a fast
system, 99.99% of the time through that loop you're setting the loc to
exactly the same coordinate! <p> I think the biggest problem here is that OSs have evolved way
beyond the point where even developers (or at least most of our
customers) understand how they work. There's nothing wrong at all with
things like "the mouse" on single-user single-tasking OSs like MacOS,
but that's just not the world we live in anymore... </p>
			<p> I'm certainly sympathetic to the "easier way" and
"programming for the rest of us" arguments, but none of us can afford
to be classed as developers of system-hostile applications...
Developing in a high level language will become a stigma that we'll
never live down... </p>
		</i>
	</blockquote>
	<p> Some of the processes that can
slow down or stop when a script uses this kind of processor-intensive
repeat loop are: file and printer sharing, HTTP/FTP servers, network
management tools, and on UNIX systems (including Mac OS X), people
telnetting in from other systems. Another problem on Mac OS X is the
spinning rainbow cursor that may appear while the loop is in progress
if the operation takes too long — the system puts that up whenever it
thinks an application is unresponsive. That means if a user drags an
object around the card for a while, or keeps the mouse button depressed
for too long while the script is in a loop, the system may think your
application has gone dead. </p><p>
		The problem is not limited to just checking <code>the mouseloc</code>
or the mouse's up or down state. Checking any of the following mouse
events within a loop can cause a bottleneck and should be avoided: </p>
<ul>
	<li>
		the mouse -- i.e., "up" or "down" 
	</li>
	<li>
		the mouseClick 
	</li>
	<li>
		the mouseH 
	</li>
	<li>
		the mouseV 
	</li>
	<li>
		the mouseLoc 
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>So what do I do?</h3> 
<p class="first">
You may be wondering at this point, "If I shouldn't be using a repeat loop to determine the state of the mouse, what <i>do</i> I use?"
</p>
<p>
The answer lies in the <code>mouseMove</code> system message, sent by the MetaCard/Revolution engine whenever the user moves the mouse. The <code>mouseMove</code>
message carries two parameters with it: the horizontal and vertical
coordinates of the current mouse position. By writing a handler that
traps this system message, you can create an OS-friendly script that
will not bottleneck the CPU and which will run far more efficiently
than any repeat loop.
</p>
<p>
There is an additional advantage to using the <code>mouseMove</code>
approach: it allows your stack to continue sending events and reporting
other user actions simultaneously. Unlike a repeat loop, which locks
out everything else until the handler ends, trapping a system message
takes an insignificant amount of time and allows other system messages
and all your stack's features to continue operating at the same time.
You may not always want to use the other messages that are being sent,
but they are there if you need them.
</p>
<h3>How it works</h3> 
<p class="first">In the above example, all we want to do is move a
button to the same location as the current mouse position, for as long
as the mouse button is depressed. If the mouse is "up", the script
should do nothing. A short handler in the button script could take care
of it: </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>on mouseMove x,y
  if the mouse is down then set the loc of me to x,y
end mouseMove</pre> 
</blockquote>
<p class="first">
Very easy. At the same time that <code>mouseMove</code>
is catching the position of the mouse and handling the drag, you can
also have other handlers running normally to catch various system
messages or handle other events. You can think of <code>mouseMove</code> as a sort of customized, single-purpose <code>idle</code> message. (Note though that <code>idle</code> has its own set of processor-hogging problems, and should be avoided at all costs too.)
</p>
<p>
But wait. The <code>mouseMove</code> handler is still polling the
mouse, checking for its down state repeatedly. So while we have
improved the script's efficiency, it is still using more resources than
necessary. We can fix that by adding a variable that stores the state
of the mouse, so that the engine won't have to check it each time. We
can set a flag on <code>mouseDown</code>, and turn it off on <code>mouseRelease</code> and <code>mouseUp</code>.
While we're at it, we'll also add a line to the script that passes the
ID of the object we are dragging so that more than one button can
respond to the <code>mouseMove</code> message.
</p>
<p>
These handlers would go in the card or stack script: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>on mouseDown
  global gDragging,gDragObj,gDeltaX,gDeltaY -- (you could use local script variables instead)
  if the name of the target contains "button" then
    put true into gDragging
    put the long id of the target into gDragObj
    -- the following adjusts for the mouse position on the object;
    -- it isn't part of what we're explaining here but it enhances the drag:
    put item 1 of the loc of gDragObj - the mouseH into gDeltaX
    put item 2 of the loc of gDragObj - the mouseV into gDeltaY
  end if
end mouseDown

on mouseRelease
  global gDragging
  put false into gDragging
end mouseRelease

on mouseUp
  global gDragging
  put false into gDragging
end mouseUp

on mouseMove x,y
  global gDragging,gDragObj,gDeltaX,gDeltaY
  if gDragging = true then
    add gDeltaX to x
    add gDeltaY to y
    set the loc of gDragObj to x,y
  end if
end mouseMove</pre> 
</blockquote>
<p class="first">
Most HyperCard and SuperCard scripters are familiar with <code>mouseDown</code> and <code>mouseUp</code>, but <code>mouseRelease</code> may be new. The <code>mouseRelease</code>
message is sent to an object when the mouse button goes up but the
mouse is no longer within the borders of the object that received the
original <code>mouseDown</code> message. This covers the case where
the user may move the mouse faster than the button can keep up. Even if
the mouse is released somewhere outside the button, this script will
still set the global <code>gDragging</code> to false.
</p>
<p>
Now you've got a fast, efficient, CPU-friendly set of handlers that
won't bog down the OS or hog system resources. Applications running in
the background will still get their fair share of CPU cycles with no
performance hit. Your stack will respond much faster and will allow
other user actions and scripts to be handled simultaneously. There's no
down side, there's lots to gain, and your stack will run like a pro.
