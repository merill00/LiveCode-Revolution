Shakobox provides a way for MetaCard and Revolution to play scripted
musical notation, which in some cases can bypass the need to embed
sound files in a stack. Because the notation is scripted, handlers can
provide long instrumental selections with virtually no size overhead.
Stacks can be created to act as music editors that allow notation entry
in fields for playback "on the fly." For simple music or sound effects,
scripted notation provides a viable alternative to sound files, and
greatly reduces the size of stack files on disk. Shakobox supports all
128 instruments in the QuickTime's MIDI instrument library, which
allows a wide variety of sound effects and exceptional musical color. <p> Ingeniously written by Jon Bettencourt, Shakobox works by
launching a small, proprietary application that serves as an interface
between the stack scripts and the Macintosh QuickTime engine. On a
Macintosh, the PlayCommand Agent application receives AppleScript
commands from the stack, interprets them, and forwards the correct
syntax to QuickTime. For Windows users, the Windows version of
PlayCommand Agent allows communication with Shakobox either through the
command line, or via small text files written to a folder. </p>
			<p> The Shakobox stack itself contains all the
documentation, scripts, examples, and AppleScript support you need to
get started scripting musical notation in your stacks. It also contains
scripts that will install either the 68K or OS X version of the
PlayCommand Agent application, which is contained within the stack
itself as a set of custom resources. If you plan to distribute your
musical stacks, you can use the included installer scripts to make sure
that your users also have this required application installed. Windows
users should download the .zip file instead, which does not contain an
installer stack but does come with a text file explaining instructions
for use. </p>
			<p> Shakobox for Mac will work with MacOS 8, 9 or X.
Shakobox for Windows works with any version of Windows from Win95 to
XP. QuickTime, and either Runtime Revolution or MetaCard are required
for either platform. Shakobox's PlayCommand Agent was written by and is
Copyright 2002 by Jon Bettencourt. Shakobox stack design, scripting,
and documentation is by HyperActive Software. </p>
