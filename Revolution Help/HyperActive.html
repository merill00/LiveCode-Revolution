		<i>In
addition to understanding the Standalone Builder, the following
reference information may be useful when preparing to distribute your
application.</i>
	</p>
	<h2>Icons</h2> 
	<p> Revolution's standalone
builder automatically copies any Revolution icons assigned to buttons
into the standalone. However, only those icons actually assigned to
buttons at the time the standalone is built are recorded. You must add
others yourself. The best way is to transfer them as images into your
stack before building. </p><h3>Standalone icons - Creating icons for the desktop</h3> A tutorial with some sample files on creating icons for both Macs and PCs is at: 
<p>
	<a href="http://www.altuit.com/webs/altuit2/RunRev/Tutorials.htm">http://www.altuit.com/webs/altuit2/RunRev/Tutorials.htm</a> 
</p><p>
	<i>Windows desktop icon types</i> 
</p><p> These must be created using the Windows ".ico" file type. Icons
for each of these variations must be made and placed into a Windows
icon file. The easiest way to do this is to use an icon editor. </p><p>
	These variations compose a standard Windows icon set. Revolution's standalone builder requires that all are present: 
</p><blockquote>
	16 Color (4-bit) 16x16
	<br>
		16 color (4-bit) 32x32
	<br>
		16 color (4-bit) 48x48
	<br>
		256 color (8-bit) 16x16
	<br>
		256 color (8-bit) 32x32
	<br>
		256 color (8-bit) 48x48
	<br>
		Windows XP (32-bit) 16x16
	<br>
		Windows XP (32-bit) 32x32
	<br>
		Windows XP (32-bit) 48x48
	<br>
</blockquote>
<i>Windows icon editors:</i> 
<p>
There are many editors available for creating Windows icon files. Some
popular recommendations from participants on the Revolution mailing
list: </p><p>
Axialis Icon Workshop <a href="http://www.axialis.com/">http://www.axialis.com/</a>
<br>
	Frontbase Image to Icon <a href="http://www.make-icon.com/">http://www.make-icon.com/</a>
<br>
Microangelo <a href="http://www.microangelo.us/">http://www.microangelo.us/</a>
<br>
IconCool Editor <a href="http://www.iconcool.com/">http://www.iconcool.com</a>/ 
</p><p>
<i>Macintosh OS X icon types</i> 
</p><p>
Macintosh OS X icons must be created in a special OS X icon file. The
easiest way to do this is to use an icon editor. OS X includes a
rudimentary icon editor if you install the Developer Tools that come
with the OS. </p><p>
These variations compose the standard Macintosh icon set (are all 32 bit with a 1-bit mask) 
</p><blockquote>
16x16
<br>
	32x32
<br>
	48x48
<br>
	128x128
</blockquote>
You don't have to make all of them. If some are missing, the OS will
scale another one to fit if it needs a missing size. If you are only
going to make one, make the 128-pixel size. Making all the sizes gives
you better control over their appearance, however.
<br>
<i>Macintosh OS X icon editors</i> 
<blockquote>
Iconographer <a href="http://www.mscape.com/products/iconographer.html">http://www.mscape.com/products/iconographer.html</a>
<br>
	Icon Composer (included in OS X Developer Tools)
</blockquote>
<br>
<i>Macintosh OS 9 icon types</i> 
<p>OS 9 icons must be created in a resource editor, which is almost
always ResEdit. Icons and other resources are usually edited after the
standalone is built; however, you only need to do this once. Once it
has been created, you can extract the resource fork as a separate file
on disk. Revolution's standalone builder allows you to to include this
resource file in each subsequent build. </p><p>
You will need icons for resources: ic14, ic18, icns, ics4, and ics8.
ResEdit allows you to edit all of these in the same editing window.
Create one (usually the ic18 full-color resource) and you can drag it
to the other sizes to auto-duplicate it at different color depths. Put
your standalone icon into resource 128 of ic18. Put your stack icon
into resource 129. </p><p>
There is more information in the "Deployment" section at Ken Ray's tips site here: 
</p><p>

<br>
<i>Linux icon types</i> 
</p><p>
KDE and GNOME both use either of these icon sizes: 
</p><blockquote>
32x32
<br>
	45x45
</blockquote>
To create icons in Linux, you don't need any special software. Most
icons in KDE and GNOME use the .PNG file type which can be created by
most graphics editors. Icons for standalones are applied after the
standalone is built and integrating them is part of the OS interface
(users can do this too and change your icon at will.) <p>
Because any graphics program can create icons, there are not a lot of specialized tools. These two showed up in a search:

<h2>File Associations: double-clicking stacks to open in your standalone</h2> 
<br>
<i>Windows</i> 
<p>
You will need to set registry entries. You can do this via scripts, or
if you use an installer program, you can let it do the file
associations for you. Using an installer program is easiest. If you
want to do it by script, Ken Ray's tip site has an explanation in the
File/Folder Manipulation section here: </p><p>
<a href="http://www.sonsothunder.com/index2.htm?http://www.sonsothunder.com/devres/revolution/revolution.htm">http://www.sonsothunder.com/index2.htm?http://www.sonsothunder.com/devres/revolution/revolution.htm</a> 
</p><p>
<i>Macintosh OS 9</i> 
</p><p>
Macs associate files by assigning a creator code and a type code. The
creator code is unique to your application. The type code may be either
unique to your application, or shared by other applications (for
example, many applications can open text files, so the TEXT file type
is common across many applications.) </p><p>
The Revolution standalone builder allows you to set the file type and
creator codes that your standalone will use. For personal use, you may
use any series of 4 letters you like, provided they are not in use by
other applications on your drive. If you plan to distribute the
standalone to others, you will need a unique creator code. You can look
up and register creator codes at Apple Computer's registry: </p><p>
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/dev/cftype/faq.html">http://developer.apple.com/dev/cftype/faq.html</a> 
</p><p>
<i>Macintosh OS X</i> 
</p><p>
Macintosh OS X uses two ways of associating applications and their
files; both creator and type codes as well as file name extensions. For
files that are not application bundles, OS X looks for a type code
first. If the file does not have a type code, then it looks at the file
extension to determine what applications can open it. All Mac OS X
applications are contained in “bundles”, which are really folders that
the OS treats as a single file. Inside the bundle is a plist document.
The plist is an XML document that describes many things about the
application, including what files it can open and what creator and type
codes it uses.
</p>
<h2>Building standalones on one platform for deployment on another</h2> 
<p>Revolution can build standalones for any platform while running on
any other platform, with one exception; you can't build a standalone
for Mac OS 9 while running on a Windows or a Unix machine. Because Mac
OS 9 standalones require a resource fork, you must be running MacOS or
Mac OS X to build for that platform. You can, however, build for OS X
from any other machine.
</p>
<h2>Standalone Builder Easter egg</h2> 
<p>There is an easter egg in the standalone builder. If you create a
components/save/userscripts directory and put your own library stacks
in there, you can choose them in the Standalone Builder script
libraries list and they will be put in use with the rest of the
Revolution libraries.
</p>
<h2>Distribution packages and installers</h2> 
<p>There are several commercial and shareware installer packages that
allow you to distribute your standalone and all its associated files in
a single package. These allow your users to install your software by
clicking a button. These installers typically allow you to determine
where on the hard drive your files will be placed, and they will set up
file associations and other OS requirements for you.
</p>
<p>
Some typical installer packages: 
</p><p>
Installer VICE is a commercial package that makes installers for Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, and Windows
