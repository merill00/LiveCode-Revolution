    Computers in the Humanities
    Media File Formats

The following information was gathered from several web sites.

*Common Graphics Formats*
PDF 	Adobe Portable Document Format
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format> 	.pdf 	Used to
package text and graphics into platform-independent documents. The
cross-platform Adobe Acrobat application allows virtually any computer
user to read PDFs. This is the standard graphics format in Apple's
operating system, OS X.
GIF* 	CompuServe?s Graphics Interchange Format
<http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dictionary/Graphics%2BInterchange%2BFormat>
	.gif 	Along with JPEG, one of the two original standard graphics
formats on the Web. This format supports up to 256 colors (8 bits per
pixel) and incorporates "lossless" compression resulting in manageble
file size. That is, the original image is restored exactly upon
uncompressing the file. In many cases, GIF images preserve all of the
detail and color present in the original images. Supports transparency
(alpha channels).
PNG* 	Portable Network Graphics
<http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngintro.html> 	.png 	A lossless graphics
format that was designed to replace the older and simpler GIF format
and, to some extent, the much more complex TIFF format. Gaining support
by web browsers, graphics editing applications, and others (including
Revolution!) Supports transparency. PNG is pronounced ?ping?.
JPEG* 	Joint Photographic Experts Group images.
<http://www.widearea.co.uk/designer/compress.html> 	.jpeg, .jpg, .jfif
JPEG format supports full color (24-bits per pixel). It incorporates
?lossy? compression. That is, the original image cannot be exactly
restored when the file is decompressed. Therefore, image quality is
degraded somewhat to achieve a smaller file size. However, JPEG permits
very small file sizes even for fairly large full-color images.
TIFF 	Tagged Image File Format
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_Image_File_Format> 	.tif,.tiff 	The
Tagged-Image File Format (TIFF) is used to exchange documents between
different applications and different computer platforms. TIFF provides
the maximum quality at the expense of large file sizes and thus slow
transmission of images. It supports full color (24-bits per pixel). TIFF
may be compressed using lossless compression.
EPS 	Adobe Encapsulated Postscript
<http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/graphics/postscript.html> 	.eps
Used in documents intended for printing. Very high quality vector graphics.
BMP* 	Windows Bitmapped image file
<http://www.fileformat.info/format/bmp/egff.htm> 	.bmp, .dib, .vga, 	BMP
(an abbreviation of ?bitmap?) is the standard bitmapped graphics format
on Windows-compatible computers. Files are usually stored uncompressed,
so quality of the image remains high (a ?lossless? format) and file size
tends to be large. It is an aging but still widely supported format,
especially in the Windows environment.
PICT* 	Macintosh QuickDraw/PICT format
<http://www.prepressure.com/library/file-formats/pict> 	.pict, .pict2,
.pic 	The PICT format is an older format that was widely used among
Macintosh page layout and graphics applications as an intermediary file
format used for transferring documents between applications. The PICT
format is especially effective at compressing images that contain large,
flat areas of color.

    *Formats supported for display and import into Revolution image
    objects. Note that PICT format is supported only on Macintosh
    systems. Many other formats, including TIFF and PDF, are supported
    via QuickTime in player objects.

*Common Motion Video Formats and Compressions*
MPEG-1? 	Moving Picture Experts Group movie file
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1> 	.mpeg, .mpg 	MPEG is an older
digital motion picture compression format that is widely supported. It
supports full-color, full-motion video using a lossy compression which
results in quite compact files.
MPEG-2 	MPEG-2 movie file <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2> 	.m2v,
.mpeg2 	MPEG-2 is similar to the MPEG (or MPEG-1) format but includes
extensions to cover a wider range of applications. This format is used
for videos on DVD.
MPEG-4? 	MPEG-4 movie file <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4> 	.mp4
MPEG-4 was defined by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), the
working group within the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO). Developed to be a new worldwide standard for multimedia delivery
over the internet. The H.263 codec is the basis for MPEG-4.
     H.264? 	MPEG-4 AVC (Advanced Video Coding)
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC> 	 - 	One of the most
advanced video codecs available today. It enables the efficient
transmission of high-quality high-definition (HD) television signals and
storage of HD video on DVDs. H.264 gives excellent results across a
broad range of bandwidths, from cell phones to broadcast. It has been
incorporated into the MPEG-4 standard.
DV 	MiniDV <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiniDV> 	 - 	The native storage
format used by virtually all consumer-grade digital video cameras.
Stored high quality video with very light, lossless compression.
QuickTime? 	Apple QuickTime time-based file format
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicktime> 	.mov, .qt 	Apple Computer's
multi-platform, industry-standard, multimedia software architecture. It
is used by software developers, hardware manufacturers, and content
creators to author and publish synchronized graphics, sound, video,
text, music, VR, and 3D media. Supports all major motion, still, and
audio compression formats.
QuickTime 4 and higher include strong support for "real" (RTSP) streaming.
WMV 	Windows Media Video
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Video> 	.wmv 	A set of
Microsoft proprietary streaming video technologies. Since the format is
not open, WMV can only be run and edited using Microsoft software or
third-party converters.
AVI 	Video for Windows <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVI> 	.avi 	AVI
stands for Audio Video Interleave. It was primarily aimed at CD-ROM
video, although it is also used on the web to some degree. It is limited
in many ways. It runs on Windows only, doesn't handle audio/video
synchronization as well as QuickTime and doesn't support variable-length
frames. It is no longer supported by Microsoft, and is being
incorporated into DirectShow.
RM 	Real Video <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealVideo> 	.ram, .rm 	A
closed, proprietary streaming format developed by Real Networks for
streaming audio and video over the internet. Requires Real software to
run and edit.

    ?Digital video formats supported in Revolution via QuickTime in
    player objects.

*Common Audio formats*
AU*? 	Sun Microsystems'
µ-law <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/au_file_format> 	.au 	The early,
unofficial Internet standard, developed by Sun Microsystems and used
commonly on the NeXT operating system. Even though it's not the highest
quality audio file format available, it's relatively small file size and
the availability of players for just about every operating system made
it an early favorite for Web users. At a sampling rate of 8kHz, it's
sound quality is roughly equivalent to that of standard telephone
receivers.
AIFF*? 	Apple's Audio Interchange File Format
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiff> 	.aiff, .aif, .aifc 	Also a fairly
common sampled sound format. Since it is an interchange format, it is
easily converted to other file formats. For these reasons, it is often
used in high-end audio recording applications when storage space is not
a concern. Originally developed by Apple, this format is used
predominantly by Silicon Graphics and Macintosh applications. AIFF files
can be quite large. One minute of 16-bit stereo audio sampled at 44.1kHz
usually takes up about 10 megabytes. Supports mono and stereo samples at
a variety of sample rates. Can be compressed.
WAVE*? 	Microsoft's 16-bit RIFF format <wikipedia.org/wiki/Wav> 	.wav
The default audio format for Windows systems. It is very similar to the
AIFF format in that it supports monaural and stereo samples and a
variety of sample rates. Like AIFF, WAVE files require approximately
10mb/min for 16-bit samples with a sampling rate of 44.1kHz, but 8-bit,
8kHz, single channel versions are often offered by sites. Not easily
compressed.
MIDI? 	Musical Instrument Digital Interface
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midi> 	.midi, .mid 	Unlike the other
formats listed here, the Musical Instrument Digital Interface is not a
specification for sampled digital audio. Instead, it is a serial
communications protocol designed to allow the transmission of control
data between electronic music instruments. It has been likened to a
PostScript language for music. Since MIDI contains only instructions for
controlling how and when devices, most frequently electronic
synthesizers or samplers, produce sounds, the files are much smaller
than digitized audio files. The MIDI Manufacturer Association (MMA), a
group of electronic music instrument manufacturers, has been responsible
for the evolution of the MIDI protocol since its inception in 1983.
SND? 	Macintosh System 7 sound format
<http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/format/SND.html> 	.snd
The older Macintosh sound format. These files can consist of AIFF/AIFC
samples and/or of synthesized sounds that can take advantage of the
System 7 sound hardware and software. Similar to .au format.
MP3? 	MPEG Layer III <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp3> 	 .mp3 	MPEG
Layer 3 (commonly known as MP3) is a very popular standard for delivery
of music on the Internet. It produces highly compressed, but still very
high quality audio, most commonly around 16kBytes (128kbits) per second.
These data rates don't support modem streaming, so MP3 files are
generally downloaded for later playback. Virtually all commercial music
players (such as iPod and Zune) support MP3.
AAC? 	 Advanced Audio Coding
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding> 	.aac, .m4a 	The
audio part of the public MPEG 4 video standard. AAC provides audio
encoding that compresses much more efficiently than older formats such
as MP3, yet delivers quality rivaling that of uncompressed CD audio.
This is the main format used by Apple for music downloads from the
iTunes music store and in the iPod. Optionally supports Digital Rights
Management (DRM).
WMA 	Windows Media Audio
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Audio> 	.wma 	A proprietary
audio compression technology introduced by Microsoft as a competitor to
MP3. Delivers sound quality comparable to AAC and MP3. Performs well at
lower bitrates. Supports DRM. Limited mainly to Windows OS and related
products, but can be accessed by Linux and Mac OS using third-party
software.
Ogg Vorbis 	Ogg Vorbis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg_vorbis> 	.ogg
Ogg Vorbis is an free, open source, lossy audio codec project headed by
the Xiph.Org Foundation and intended to serve as a replacement for MP3.
It gives similar compression to MP3 at equal or slightly better quality.
Popularity is spreading, but nowhere near as universal as MP3.

    *Formats supported by the Revolution play command. Note that only
    uncompressed sounds can be played by the play command.
    ?Formats supported in Revolution via QuickTime in player objects.
    Player objects also support compressed sounds in AIFF and WAVE formats.
