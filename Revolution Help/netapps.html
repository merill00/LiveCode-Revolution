							<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
While the Web browser may be ideally suited for viewing data, its
design is not optimized for creating or manipulating data. With the
advent of Web applications, many interface designers have been limiting
their work to those systems which can be delivered in a Browser window.
Using a wider range of tools, technologies, and protocols, a designer
may find some tasks better served through Net-aware desktop
applications.<br>

						<h3>1. Introduction: The Internet is not the Web</h3>
						<p>The
Internet is used for a wide variety of tasks, from transferring files
to sending email. These tasks also include viewing text, graphics, and
rich-media content using the World Wide Web. While the Web is a
relatively recent newcomer to the range of Internet services, its
popularity has eclipsed the other services of the Internet. Today, many
lay people think "the Web" and "the Internet" are synonymous.</p>
						<p>With
the growing ubiquity of the Web, many application designers have felt
that the next logical step is to migrate tasks from desktop
applications to the Web Browser window. Some tasks are well suited for
the Browser, taking advantage of users' confidence in the inherent
simplicity of the Browser environment.</p>
						<p>But this same
simplicity also introduces unique challenges, from interface layout to
handling protocols other than HTTP, which can be handled well in
dedicated applications.</p>
						<p>Word processing and many other
traditional computing applications involve tasks which are essentially
solitary in nature; the files may benefit from being shared among, and
even modified by, multiple users, but the nature of the task itself
(crafting a spreadsheet, retouching a photo, writing a letter) is
generally something one does by themselves.</p>
						<p>Then there are
tasks which are inherently group-oriented, which take on additional
value when connected to multiple computers. Email, for example, has
little practical value without other users involved. It is for these
connected-computing tasks that the Internet is especially useful, and
only a subset of these tasks is optimal when implemented inside a
Browser window.</p>
						<p>The term "Web app" has been used to
describe applications that live inside a Browser window. This paper
introduces the term "Net app" to describe Internet-connected
applications implemented as independent processes with their own user
interface.</p>
						<p>Figure 1 shows a conceptual illustration of
various application types. In a modern GUI, all applications are
desktop applications, as the desktop is the primary object serving as
an enclosure for the user experience. A subset of applications are
network applications (Net Apps), which use Internet protocols to
provide the benefits unique to distributed computing. The Web Browser
is one of these, but there are many others, including email, FTP
clients, instant messaging, etc.</p>

						<p><br>While
the Browser will remain a useful option for network applications, the
growing popularity of peer-to-peer (P2P) tools like Naptster and the
Gnutella network, and messaging tools like AOL Instant Messenger and
ICQ, suggest that dedicated applications may be more useful for some
tasks.<br>
							<br>
						</p>
						<h3>2. Inside the Browser or Outside: Viewing vs. Authoring</h3>
						<p>When
deciding among alternatives for implementing connected-computing
applications, it is useful to consider the nature of the task the
application will support. The Browser presents unique strengths and
weaknesses, and not all tasks are optimally supported once we examine
its core functionality.</p>
						<p>Some guidance can be found in the
origins of the Browser, examining the specific range of tasks it was
designed to support. The Web was invented as a means of allowing
researchers to view documents created by other researchers. With the
invention of the graphical Browser these documents could also include
graphics and other media. The controls provided in the Browser
interface reflect this passive-viewing orientation, focused as they are
on tasks involving navigation among Web pages.</p>
						<p>Later
JavaScript was added to Netscape Navigator and JScript to Microsoft
Internet Explorer, making it possible to add interactivity to Web
pages. The scripting languages allow both client-side applications like
calculators as well as client-server applications such as submitting
forms to a CGI application.</p>
						<p>The range of user interactions
within the Browser has expanded even more with tools like Java and
Macromedia Flash. While interfaces created with these technologies may
be placed within a Web page they are not fully integrated into the
Browser experience. and the disparity between how Browsers behave with
HTML-only pages and Flash- or Java-enhanced pages may cause confusion
for the user. For example, using the Browser's Back button while
viewing Flash media will not take the user to the previous screen
layout in Flash, but in most cases it will instead completely remove
the Flash element altogether as it loads the previously-viewed page in
its place. For this reason, many developers using Java and Flash do so
in secondary popup windows which hide the navigation controls,
effectively attempting to emulate a desktop application experience
within the confines of the Browser.</p>
						<p>Such attempts to
provide the interaction functionality common in desktop applications
meet with a number of limitations. In addition to the disparity between
the Browser's inherent navigation functionality and that of the applet
residing within it, the designer also faces these considerations:</p>
						<h4>Controls - Layout</h4>
						<blockquote>
							<p>One
example of limitations in designing applications in the Browser is
dynamic composition, designing control layouts that adjust themselves
to fit in windows which can be resized by the user. While common in
desktop applications, dynamic compositions are difficult to implement
in a Browser. AOL's New Email form is a good case in point, shown in
Figure 2.</p>
							<div align="center">
								<br>
								<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="600">
									<tbody><tr>
										<td>
											<div align="center">
												<img src="netapps_files/diagram2.gif" alt="Venn diagram of application types" height="260" width="591"></div>
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="body">
											<div align="center">
												<i><br>
													
												Figure 2: AOL New Email form, shown in the Web version (left) and in the Desktop software.<br>
												</i></div>
										</td>
									</tr>
								</tbody></table>
								<br>
							</div>
							<p>The
limitations of HTML do not allow the primary content region (where the
user types their email message) to resize to match the size the user
has selected for the window.</p>
							<p>Also note that significantly
less screen space is devoted to the task the interface ostensibly
supports. More than half of the non-task space is altogether unused,
with the rest comprised largely of advertisements and other links
designed to take the user away from the task at hand. While common in
the Web experience, such elements serve to distract from the goal of
the page, effectively becoming &#8220;anti-features&#8221;.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<h4>Controls - Behavior</h4>
						<blockquote>
							<p>The
two implementations of AOL's email interface illustrate another
limitation in designing applications in the Browser: many features and
controls are difficult or impossible to create using HTML and
JavaScript.</p>
							<p>While AOL's Web team did a good job of
approximating the control layout and essential functionality of the
Desktop application, note that the Desktop version supports an array of
text styling attributes not present in the Browser-based version
(Figure 2, outlined in red).</p>
							<p>Other Desktop features not
supported in the Web interface include the ability to compress
attachments, to have more than one email attachment, and to save an
email message without sending it.</p>
							<p>Another small but
pervasive example of unusual behavior of controls in the Browser is the
target area of radio and checkbox controls on Web pages. In desktop
applications, both the label and indicator portions of the control are
active areas which respond to the user's mouse click, but most Browser
implementations limit the target area to the indicator only, as
illustrated in Figure 3. This measurably hampers its usefulness
according to <a href="http://www.asktog.com/columns/022DesignedToGiveFitts.html" target="_blank">Fitt's Law</a>,
which suggests that "the time to acquire a target is a function of the
distance to and size of the target". Only some of the most recent
Browsers allow the option for standard target areas for radio controls
and checkboxes, and merely upgrading the Browser does not fix the
problem; pages must be rewritten to employ the correct behavior.</p>

									</tr>
								</tbody></table>
								<br>
							</blockquote>
						</blockquote>
						<h4>Menus</h4>
						<blockquote>
							<p>And
while users are accustomed to finding commands in the menu bar, in a
Browser the menu bar belongs exclusively to the Browser itself. Without
the ability for Web apps to modify the Browser's menu bar, designers
have adopted a wide range of workaround pull-down menus written in
JavaScript. These workaround menus employ a dismayingly broad range of
interaction behaviors with little or no consistency between
applications, and almost never behave like the "normal" menu bar users
are already familiar with. These inconsistencies are compounded by the
broadly different implementations of the JavaScript language, as any
UNIX or Mac OS user can tell you about their experiences at sites
developed exclusively for one platform.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<h4>File I/O</h4>
						<blockquote>
							<p>The
ability to read and write data to files is essential for any
application that requires persistent information across sessions.
Attempting a modest level of security, Browsers do not normally allow
Web pages, or even plug-ins, the ability to read and write to disk.
Instead the Browser provides <i>cookies</i>, a mechanism for storing
only a small about of data on the client machine which can be used to
lookup significant data stored on the server. Cookies requires multiple
HTTP transactions for each discrete data element delivered to the
interface, while a desktop application can access even large amounts of
data in milliseconds from local storage.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<h4>Responsiveness</h4>
						<blockquote>
							<p>In
addition to the latency introduced by the lack of file I/O support, Web
apps are made even less responsive than their desktop counterparts by
requiring the interface to be downloaded every time it is used. In
contrast, the AOL client provides an excellent balance between
downloaded and local components, storing consistent user interface
elements on the client machine and downloading new interface elements
and timely content as needed.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<h4>Protocols</h4>
						<blockquote>
							<p>While
the Internet supports a wide variety of protocols for different tasks,
the Browser primarily handles only HTTP natively, with some limited
support for FTP. Other protocols like SMTP (email), NNTP (newsgroups),
Gnutella (file sharing), IRC (chat), and others require Java or a
plug-in to implement inside the Browser, and are more commonly
supported in dedicated applications.<br>
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>Given
these considerations, we can see that some applications can work well
inside a Browser window, but other tasks can be clumsy or even
altogether impractical when attempted outside of an environment
dedicated to that task. Many articles have been published extolling the
virtues of Browser-based applications, but few (if any) of these were
written in one; most were written in a dedicated word processor.</p>
						<p>Tasks
like word processing, graphics production, and other media-creation
tasks provide a useful distinction for the domain of dedicated
applications: they involve <i>creating</i> data. In contrast, successful Browser applications are more commonly oriented toward the <i>viewing</i> of data.<br>
							<br>
						</p>
						<h3>3. Security Considerations</h3>
						<p>One
of the perceived benefits of choosing to implement an application in a
Browser is security. By restricting file I/O, and through encrypted
transmissions via protocols like HTTPS, browsers offer a level of
security that is perceived as generally acceptable to even large
corporations.</p>
						<p>However, few security restrictions exist for
embedded objects like ActiveX controls and Director XTRAs, and such
objects are not unusual on the Web.</p>
						<p>In most Browsers, by
default the user must explicitly confirm the download and installation
of such objects. But doing so changes the discussion of security from
anything unique to the browser, and reframes it as a matter of the
trust the user feels for the site providing the embedded object.</p>
						<p>Given
the growing prevalence of executable code transferred over the
Internet, and as illustrated by such OS-specific viruses as Code Red
and SirCam, the Browser's role in ensuring security is apparently
limited. While many corporations choose Web applications for the
perceived security, most of the corporations also choose the Windows
family of operating systems, where increasing exploitation of security
holes unique to that OS family cost those corporations US$3.6 billion
cleaning up after Code Red and SirCam alone.</p>
						<p>In terms of
actual security, the informed user should have as much confidence
downloading an application from a trusted provider as they would any
other object code such as an ActiveX control. Net apps can use the same
protocols as Browser applications, including HTTPS, to provide similar
levels of security for outgoing data. </p>
						<p>In practical
terms, the risks of running a standalone Net application are not
significantly greater than for many embedded objects commonly included
in Web pages.</p>
						<p></p>
						<h3>4. Options for Net App Capabilities: More than P2P</h3>
						<p>Once
we begin to look for development opportunities outside the Browser, we
find that most of the press devoted to such alternatives focuses on
peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) exclusively. While Napster and GNUtella
have indeed earned significant attention, there's so much more to the
Internet than file sharing.</p>
						<p>One of the biggest growth
categories over the last year has been instant messaging, with tools
like AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Microsoft Messenger, Yahoo Messenger,
Hotline, ICQ, and others. In addition to providing real-time text
exchange between users, most of these applications also provide group
chat, file sharing, and other services.</p>
						<p>And "push
technology", in which users can choose to have specific information
sent to them instead of going on to the Web to get it, seems to be on a
comeback. While initial proponents of push like Marimba focused on
marketing uses, push technology can be more valuable as a business
tool, delivering timely rich-media content to employees.</p>
						<p>When
designing custom Net apps, you can mix and match these and other
technologies in much more flexible ways than can be achieved in the
Browser. Table 1 provides a brief listing of popular Internet
protocols, noting those supported in the most popular Browsers:</p>

						<h3>5. Tools for Creating Net Apps</h3>
						<p>One
of the key factors which have contributed to the success of the Web is
its inherent platform-independent nature: users can have a similar
experience regardless of which operating system they use. Accordingly,
any tools used for building Net apps should also run on as many
platforms as possible.</p>
						<p>Even corporate intranets, where
internal staff often determines specific machine configurations, can
benefit from platform independence. It's not uncommon for large
corporations to have mostly Windows-based systems, but also have UNIX
servers and Macintosh clients in some departments.</p>
						<p>Given
the many significant differences between OS families, developing
multi-platform applications in traditional languages like C++ is
cost-prohibitive for all but the largest organizations. In response,
new platform-independent languages like Java have emerged. </p>
						<p>But for the reasons John K. Osterhaut describes in his paper, <a href="http://dev.scriptics.com/doc/scripting.html" target="_blank">Scripting: Higher Level Programming for the 21st Century</a>,
there are many benefits to using fourth-generation languages (4GLs) for
developing Net apps. A number of cross-platform tools exist to allow
extremely rapid development of Net apps.</p>
						<p>Table 2 offers a
brief listing of available development tools that provide access to
Internet protocols and provide deployment on at least two platforms:</p>

Most of the assertions in this article are based solely on anecdotal
evidence, but not for lack of trying: there seems to be a dearth of
published research of the usability differences between the Web and the
